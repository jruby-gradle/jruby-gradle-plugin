= "Gradle Feature Spotlight: Continuous Build"
:page-layout: base

Earlier this year the link:http://gradle.org[Gradle] project released version
link:https://docs.gradle.org/2.5/release-notes[2.5] with a heap of new features
and improvements. One of the most touted of those features is an incubating
feature (read: beta) named
link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/continuous_build.html[Continuous
Build] which automatically re-executes tasks after a file change. Rubyists may
recognize that this functionality is similar to what
link:http://guardgem.org/[the guard gem] provides.

What makes "continuous build" special is that it makes use of the _existing_
build data present in your Gradle build. Using a
link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/more_about_tasks.html#sec:task_inputs_outputs[task's
inputs] the continuous build feature can automatically "watch" the appropriate
files to re-execute your task, or your tasks dependent tasks, automatically as
they change!


For users JRuby/Gradle this means that upgrading to Gradle 2.5 or later, and
ensuring your `build.gradle` declares task inputs and continuous build will
"just work!" Consider the following example for running
link:http://rspec.info[RSpec] tests:


.build.gradle
[source,gradle]
----
buildscript {
    repositories { jcenter() }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.github.jruby-gradle:jruby-gradle-plugin:1.0.3" // <1>
    }
}
apply plugin: 'com.github.jruby-gradle.base' // <2>

dependencies {
    jrubyExec 'rubygems:rspec:3.3.0' // <3>
}

import com.github.jrubygradle.JRubyExec

task spec(type: JRubyExec) {
    group 'JRuby'
    description 'Execute the RSpecs in JRuby'
    script 'rspec'
    inputs.files fileTree('spec').include('**/*.rb'), fileTree('lib').include('**/*.rb') // <4>
}
----
<1> Specify our dependency on the JRuby/Gradle link:/base/[base plugin]
<2> Apply the plugin to our current project
<3> Define our RSpec gem dependency
<4> Set our task inputs to the `.rb` files in `spec/` and in `lib/`


Using the `build.gradle` above, I can auto-execute my tests whenever a Ruby file
inside of the `spec/` (my tests) or `lib/` (my code under test) with the
following command:

    % ./gradlew -t spec

Here's some example output from my example project:

----
example-project git:(master) % ./gradlew -t spec
Continuous build is an incubating feature.
:spec

Randomized with seed 37453
..............................................

Finished in 0.52 seconds (files took 3.82 seconds to load)
46 examples, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 37453


BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Total time: 8.77 secs

Waiting for changes to input files of tasks... (ctrl-d to exit)

At this point the Gradle process is patiently waiting until I write my most
recent changes, then it kicks off the same task:

----
Change detected, executing build...

:spec

Pretty neat huh?


What makes this functionality exceptionally powerful for JRuby/Gradle users is
that it respects the task inputs but also the task dependency graph. If my `spec`
task declares a dependency on the `compileJava` task, whenever my Java source
code changes, that will trigger a re-execution of `compileJava` and in turn
`spec`!

So when you're authoring tasks, even if you're not this feature right now, be
sure to declare task inputs. That build metadata can unlock lots of interesting
functionality as Gradle continues to improve!

Continuous build is one of many examples of powerful Gradle functionality which
can easily used in JRuby/Gradle, I hope you find it useful!
